**How long do you think it will take you to complete this new feature?**

I believe it will take me one or two hours to complete this new feature.

**How many files will you need to add or update? Why?**

I believe I will need to add two files and modify two or three other files to implement this feature.
This is because I will be using a flow pane, which none of our previous code has, and since we had been creating abstract classes for each GUI element type, I plan on following that design.
The modifications to the other files will be needed to properly display the flow pane as well as the right turtles, but most of the support needed for this feature already exists.
