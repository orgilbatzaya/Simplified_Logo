#### Estimation: before looking at the old code:
1. how long do you think it will take you to complete this new feature?
   * I think it will take 1- 1.5 hours to implement the new interactive view.
2. how many files will you need to add or update? Why?
    * I think I will only need to update GUISetup to add the frontend view because
    the method for changing the turtle's image is already implemented in TurtleView.
    I also might make a class for the view itself. I would also add a few more image files.
