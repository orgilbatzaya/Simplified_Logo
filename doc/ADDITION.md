### Addition
* Improve parsing of raw text entered as command to allow for the stamps commands
* Estimation
    * less than a few hours
    * update BackMain file for parsing new commands
* Review
    * less than a few hours
    * updated one file, that was the one that contained the feature
    * took some slight debugging
* Analysis
    * the design was as bad as I remember, the parsing of the strings was not correct and hard to perform commands correctly
    * improved could be the logic of processing commands
    * it would have been difficult reading through all the code because the flow of the code is difficult to follow
