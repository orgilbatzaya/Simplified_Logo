Addition Russell (ral30)
==========================
###Estimation
* I think this will take me 1 hour to complete this feature. 
* To add these, I will need to add 3 files (2 commands 1 action), and update properties files corresponding to these new commands. 
    * The 3 files need to be added to create the 2 commands, the properties files need to be updated so that the parser can interpret the command.
###Review
* This took me an hour
* I needed to update 7 files and add 4 files. I needed to update 3 properties files to set up the parser. I needed to change the other 4 files to add methods to implement the feature. I needed to add the 4 files for 2 commands corresponding to 2 actions. 

###Analysis
* This made me feel my design was worse than I remembered because I had to go through many different files and change different things. However, my documentation was very clear in telling me exactly which files to change. 
* To improve this, I would have created another module for a controller that depends on the view and model. The controller would actually act on the turtles and would remove the duplicities.
* For people who have not worked on this, I think it would have felt repetitive because I was doing very similar tasks in Model and in View.
